Quantitative Reasoning Reflection

1.- Question 1
I decided to use the diversity of methods by planning my idea and deciding what
logics are needed. I decided to use if statements if I need the program to do
something is certain criteria are met. For example, if I want the program to
show "you lose" on the screen when the sprite was hit by the enemy, I use an if
statement that state that if the enemy collide with the character, a string of
words must be shown.
