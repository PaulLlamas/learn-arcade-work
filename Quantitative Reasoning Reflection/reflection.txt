Quantitative Reasoning Reflection

1.- Question 1
I decided to use the diversity of methods by planning my idea and deciding what
logics are needed. I decided to use if statements if I need the program to do
something is certain criteria are met. For example, if I want the program to
show "you lose" on the screen when the sprite was hit by the enemy, I use an if
statement that state that if the enemy collide with the character, a string of
words must be shown.
I decided to use classes because are very useful tool. They help concentrate
descriptions of apperance and behavior in a single place to later apply them to
an object. I also decided to use functions are a very useful tool too. They help
simplify the total code and to concentrate a specific action to later call it.
One example I can provide is in my final lab. In the lab, I created many classes
for enemies and coins to later apply them to objects and create them.
I also used lists because they are such an useful thing. You can use them to
store data in a specific place and later recall it. In my final lab, I used to
change rooms, enemies, coins, and textures.
In my project I also used loops. Loops are useful because they can repeat certain
action until the number implied is met or until a condition is met. In my case,
I used them with the functionality of creating the borderscreen, to place coins
and enemies with distance in between, and the platforms.

2.- Question 2
Having a friendly program is important as usually there is not only one programmer
working in a code, there is usually two or more. Therefore, having a program that
shows your logic and communicate the functionality of the part of the code is
important.
Having communicative variable names is important as it makes programming more
efficient by calling specifically what you need and avoiding the problem of
constantly identifying the variable and delaying the project. One example is calling
the variable x and its function is having the characteristics of the coins. x by
itself is not very intuitive, therefore delaying time making sure x is what you
need. coin could be a bette variable name as it is intuitive and avoids the before
problems.
